Overview: 

Fishnets is a memory and machine code manipulation scripting language implemented using the 

standard in and standard out *nix APIs to maintain direct compatibility with any Unix-like operating system.


Fishnets is my primary passion project that I am developing after seeing the broader shift of cyber-security enthuasts wanting to get into

memory and related binary exploitation challenges; 

but lacking the practical experience of having a common memory and 

machine code manipulation environment to explore raw memory/code manipulation in an accessible way. 

The name Fishnets comes from the expression to `hook` memory, and that to call this something lude like pegger or mem_hooker, would 

certainly lose me users, and contributors(or gain them ...?). 




Features:

1. Parsing of a prefix grammar to supply the Read, Write, Execute from the provide scripting file.
