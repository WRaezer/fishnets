Overview: 

Fishnets is a memory and machine code manipulation scripting language implemented using the 

standard in and standard out *nix APIs to maintain direct compatibility with any Unix-like operating system.

Fishnets is my primary passion project that I am developing after seeing the broader shift of cyber-security enthuasts wanting to get into

memory and related binary exploitation challenges; but lacking the practical experience of having a common memory and 

machine code manipulation environment to explore raw memory/code manipulation on 32 and 64 bit machines in an accessible way. 

The name Fishnets comes from the expression to `hook` memory, and that to call this something lude like pegger or mem_hooker, would 

certainly lose me users, and contributors(or gain them ...?). 




Features:

1. Parsing of a prefix grammar to supply the Read, Write, Execute from the provided scripting file.

2. Using a grammer of opening and closing characters to provide the start and ending addresses from which to 
   operate on.
   
3. Provide the ability to easily load machine code instructions, and using the Execute prefix.
